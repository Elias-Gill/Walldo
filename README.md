# Walldo-in-Go
A simple (static)wallpaper changer written in Go with the main goal to be light and fast.
Mainly inspired by Nitrogen, Walldo allows you to set your "wallpapers" path and list all your images in on single and
good lookin screen, change your wallpaper as fast as you can think and keep working. Nothing more and nothing less,
simple and functional.

##### Dependendies 
Walldo is written with pure Go libraries so of course you have to install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Instalation
After you have installed Go just open a new terminal (cmd) and run:
````
go install github.com/elias-gill/waldo-in-go@latest
````
Now Walldo must be available in your search bar (write "waldo-in-go") and as a command for your cmd. 
You can create a direct acces and change the icon if you want.

## Future goals
- Add al simple button to get a random wallpaper from the internet.
